<p id="29.1.1">
Unless it goes against their legitimate interests, each beneficiary must - as soon as possible
- "disseminate" its results by disclosing them to the public by appropriate means (other than
those resulting from protecting or exploiting the results), including in scientific publications
(in any medium). [General MGA]
</p>

<p id="29.1.2">
This does not change the obligation to protect results in Article 27, the confidentiality
obligations in Article 36, the security obligations in Article 37 or the obligations to protect
personal data in Article 39, all of which still apply. [General MGA]
</p>

<p id="29.1.3">
A beneficiary that intends to disseminate its results must give advance notice to the other
beneficiaries of - unless agreed otherwise - at least 45 days, together with sufficient
information on the results it will disseminate. [General MGA]
</p>

<p id="29.1.4">
Any other beneficiary may object within - unless agreed otherwise - 30 days of receiving
notification, if it can show that its legitimate interests in relation to the results or background
would be significantly harmed. In such cases, the dissemination may not take place unless
appropriate steps are taken to safeguard these legitimate interests. [General MGA]
</p>

<p id="29.1.5">
If a beneficiary intends not to protect its results, it may - under certain conditions (see
Article 26.4.1) - need to formally notify the [Commission][Agency] before dissemination
takes place. [General MGA]
</p>

<p id="29.2.1">
Each beneficiary must ensure open access (free of charge, online access for any user) to all
peer-reviewed scientific publications relating to its results. [General MGA]
</p>

<p id="29.2.2.a.1">
In particular, it must:
(a)
as soon as possible and at the latest on publication, deposit a machine-readable
electronic copy of the published version or final peer-reviewed manuscript accepted
for publication in a repository for scientific publications; [General MGA]
</p>

<p id="29.2.2.a.2">
Moreover, the beneficiary must aim to deposit at the same time the research data
needed to validate the results presented in the deposited scientific publications. [General MGA]
</p>

<p id="29.2.2.b">
In particular, it must:
(b)
ensure open access to the deposited publication - via the repository - at the latest:
(i)
on publication, if an electronic version is available for free via the publisher, or
(ii)
within six months of publication (twelve months for publications in the social
sciences and humanities) in any other case. [General MGA]
</p>

<p id="29.2.2.c.1">
In particular, it must:
(c)
ensure open access - via the repository - to the bibliographic metadata that identify
the deposited publication. [General MGA]
</p>

<p id="29.2.2.c.2">
The bibliographic metadata must be in a standard format and must include all of the
following:
<ul>
<li>the terms ["European Union (EU)" and "Horizon 2020"]["Euratom" and
Euratom research and training programme 2014-2018"];</li>
<li>the name of the action, acronym and grant number;</li>
<li>the publication date, and length of embargo period if applicable, and
<li>a persistent identifier.</li>
</ul>
[General MGA]
</p>

<p id="3.1">
Article 29.2 of the Model Grant Agreement sets out detailed legal requirements on open access to scientific publications: under Horizon 2020, each beneficiary must ensure open access to all peer-reviewed scientific publications relating to its results. [Guidelines]
</p>

<p id="3.2">
To meet this requirement, beneficiaries must, at the very least, ensure that any scientific peer reviewed publications can be read online, downloaded and printed. Since any further rights - such as the right to copy, distribute, search, link, crawl and mine - make publications more useful, beneficiaries should make every effort to provide as many of these options as possible. [Guidelines]
</p>

<p id="3.3">
Peer-reviewed publications are those assessed by other scholars. Peer review is typically, though not exclusively, organised by the journal or publisher to which an article or manuscript is submitted. However, new approaches are expected to become more prevalent in years to come. [Guidelines]
</p>

<p id="3.4">
The dominant type of scientific publication is the journal article. Grant beneficiaries are also strongly encouraged to provide open access to other types of scientific publications including
<ul>
<li> monographs </li>
<li> books </li>
<li> conference proceedings </li>
<li> grey literature (informally published written material not control led by scientific publishers, e.g. reports) </li>
</ul>
 [Guidelines]
</p>

<p id="3.5">
The open access mandate comprises 2 steps: 1. depositing publications in repositories; 2. providing open access to them.
These steps are explained in more detail below. They may or may not occur
simultaneously, depending on whether open access publishing ('gold' open
access) or self-archiving ('green' open access) is used, and, in the case of self-archiving, depending on the embargo period (if any). [Guidelines]
</p>

<p id="3.6">
Step 1 - depositing publications in repositories:
beneficiaries must deposit a machine-readable electronic copy of the published version or final peer-reviewed manuscript accepted for publication in a repository for scientific publications. This must be done as soon as possible and at the latest upon publication. This step applies even where open access publishing ('gold' open access) is chosen to ensure that the article is preserved in the long term. [Guidelines]
</p>

<p id="3.7">
'Machine-readable electronic copy' - publications must be in a format that can be used and understood by a computer. They must be stored in text file formats that are either standardised or otherwise publicly known so that anyone can develop new tools for working with the documents. [Guidelines]
</p>

<p id="3.8">
In some cases, the final version of an article can be deposited before publication, for example at the time when the article is accepted by the journal. The latest acceptable time to deposit a publication is the date of publication. Where possible, the version deposited should be identical to the published version (in layout, pagination, etc.). [Guidelines]
</p>

<p id="3.9">
A repository for scientific publications is an online archive. Institutional, subject-based and centralised repositories are all acceptable choices; repositories that claim rights over deposited publications and preclude access are not. [Guidelines]
</p>

<p id="3.10">
The Open Access Infrastructure for Research in Europe (OpenAIRE) is the recommended entry point for researchers to determine what repository to choose. It also offers support services for researchers, such as the National Open Access Desks. Other useful listings of repositories are:
<ul>
<li>Registry of Open Access Repositories (ROAR)</li>
<li>Directory of Open Access Repositories (OpenDOAR)</li>
 [Guidelines]
</ul>
</p>

<p id="3.11">
The beneficiary must also aim to deposit at the same time as the publication the research data needed to validate the results presented in the deposited scientific publications ('underlying data'), ideally in a data repository. The reason for this requirement is that the concept of 'publication' has changed rapidly in recent years, with the advent of the digital era. 'Publication' increasingly includes the data underpinning the publication and the results presented. This data is needed
to validate the results presented in the deposited scientific publication and is therefore seen as a crucial part of the publication and an important component of scientific best practice. Beneficiaries are also invited to grant open access to this data, but there is no obligation to do so. [Guidelines]
</p>

<p id="3.12">
Step 2 - providing open access to them:
after depositing publications and, where possible, underlying data, beneficiaries must ensure open access to the deposited publication via the chosen repository. [Guidelines]
</p>

<p id="3.13">
Beneficiaries can choose one of 2 main ways to meet this requirement: [Guidelines]
</p>

<p id="3.14">
1.  Self-archiving /'green' OA: beneficiaries can deposit the final peer-reviewed manuscript in a repository of their choice (see explanation of 'repository' above). They must ensure open access to the publication within at most 6 months (12 months for publications in the social sciences and humanities). [Guidelines]
</p>

<p id="3.15">
2. Open access publishing /'gold' OA: researchers can also publish in open access journals, or in hybrid journals that both sell subscriptions and offer the option of making individual articles openly accessible. Monographs can also be published either on a purely open access basis or using a hybrid business model. Article processing charges (APCs) for gold open access are eligible for reimbursement during the duration of the project (as other costs defined in article 6.2.D.3 of the Model Grant Agreement). As stated, the article must also be made accessible through a repository upon publication. [Guidelines]
</p>

<p id="3.16">
The costs of 'gold' open access publications incurred once a project is completed cannot be refunded from that project's budget. However, a mechanism is being piloted to address the issue of open access publication charges incurred once a grant agreement with the Commission has expired. This pilot project, funded under the OpenAIRE2020 project, supports Open Access publications arising from FP7 projects. Detailed information and conditions to apply for  reimbursements can be consulted in the EC/OpenAire FP7 Post-Grant Open Access Pilot Application Guidelines. [Guidelines]
</p>

<p id="3.17">
Beneficiaries must also provide open access, through the repository, to the bibliographic metadata that identify the deposited publication. These must be in a standard format and must include the following:
<ul>
<li>the terms ["European Union (EU)" &amp; "Horizon 2020"]["Euratom" &amp; Euratom research &amp; training programme 2014-2018"];</li>
<li>the name of the action, acronym &amp; grant number;</li>
<li>the publication date, the length of the embargo period (if applicable) &amp; a persistent identifier.</li>
</ul>
 [Guidelines]
</p>

<p id="3.18">
The purpose of the metadata requirement is to make it easier to find publications and ensure that EU funding is acknowledged. Mining bibliographic data is more efficient than mining full text versions. Information on EU funding must be included as part of bibliographic metadata so that Horizon 2020 can be properly monitored, statistics produced, and the programme's impact assessed. The project concerned should be properly identified by the grant number and the
project's name and/or acronym (preferably all three). [Guidelines]
</p>

<p id="3.19">
To monitor the embargo periods, the publication date and embargo period must be provided. The persistent identifier (for example a Digital Object Identifier) identifies the publication. It enables a link to be provided to an authoritative version of the publication. For example, OpenAIRE
will provide the means to check the metadata compliance of the chosen repository. [Guidelines]
</p>

<p id="3.20">
In all cases, the Commission encourages authors to retain their copyright and grant adequate licences to publishers. Creative Commons offers useful licensing solutions (e.g. CC BY or CC0 licences). This type of licence is a good legal tool for providing open access in its broadest sense. [Guidelines]
</p>

<p id="3.21">
Where possible, contributors should also be uniquely identifiable, and data uniquely attributable, through identifiers which are persistent, non-proprietary, open and interoperable (e.g. through leveraging existing sustainable initiatives such as ORCID for contributor identifiers and DataCite for data identifiers).
