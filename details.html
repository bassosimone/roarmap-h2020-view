<p id="29.1.1">
Unless it goes against their legitimate interests, each beneficiary must - as soon as possible
- "disseminate" its results by disclosing them to the public by appropriate means (other than
those resulting from protecting or exploiting the results), including in scientific publications
(in any medium). [General MGA]
</p>

<p id="29.1.2">
This does not change the obligation to protect results in Article 27, the confidentiality
obligations in Article 36, the security obligations in Article 37 or the obligations to protect
personal data in Article 39, all of which still apply. [General MGA]
</p>

<p id="29.1.3">
A beneficiary that intends to disseminate its results must give advance notice to the other
beneficiaries of - unless agreed otherwise - at least 45 days, together with sufficient
information on the results it will disseminate. [General MGA]
</p>

<p id="29.1.4">
Any other beneficiary may object within - unless agreed otherwise - 30 days of receiving
notification, if it can show that its legitimate interests in relation to the results or background
would be significantly harmed. In such cases, the dissemination may not take place unless
appropriate steps are taken to safeguard these legitimate interests. [General MGA]
</p>

<p id="29.1.5">
If a beneficiary intends not to protect its results, it may - under certain conditions (see
Article 26.4.1) - need to formally notify the [Commission][Agency] before dissemination
takes place. [General MGA]
</p>

<p id="29.2.1">
Each beneficiary must ensure open access (free of charge, online access for any user) to all
peer-reviewed scientific publications relating to its results. [General MGA]
</p>

<p id="29.2.2.a.1">
In particular, it must:
(a)
as soon as possible and at the latest on publication, deposit a machine-readable
electronic copy of the published version or final peer-reviewed manuscript accepted
for publication in a repository for scientific publications; [General MGA]
</p>

<p id="29.2.2.a.2">
Moreover, the beneficiary must aim to deposit at the same time the research data
needed to validate the results presented in the deposited scientific publications. [General MGA]
</p>

<p id="29.2.2.b">
In particular, it must:
(b)
ensure open access to the deposited publication - via the repository - at the latest:
(i)
on publication, if an electronic version is available for free via the publisher, or
(ii)
within six months of publication (twelve months for publications in the social
sciences and humanities) in any other case. [General MGA]
</p>

<p id="29.2.2.c.1">
In particular, it must:
(c)
ensure open access - via the repository - to the bibliographic metadata that identify
the deposited publication. [General MGA]
</p>

<p id="29.2.2.c.2">
The bibliographic metadata must be in a standard format and must include all of the
following:
<ul>
<li>the terms ["European Union (EU)" and "Horizon 2020"]["Euratom" and
Euratom research and training programme 2014-2018"];</li>
<li>the name of the action, acronym and grant number;</li>
<li>the publication date, and length of embargo period if applicable, and
<li>a persistent identifier.</li>
</ul>
[General MGA]
</p>

<p id="3.1">
The detailed legal requirements on open access to publications are contained in article 29.2 of
the Model Grant Agreement. [Guidelines]
</p>

<p id="3.2">
Under Horizon 2020, each beneficiary must ensure open access to all peer-reviewed scientific
publications relating to its results. [Guidelines]
</p>

<p id="3.3">
In order to comply with this requirement, beneficiaries must, at the very least, ensure that
their publications, if any, can be read online, downloaded and printed. However, as any
additional rights such as the right to copy, distribute, search, link, crawl, and mine increase
the utility of the accessible publication, beneficiaries should make every effort to provide for
as many of them as possible. [Guidelines]
</p>

<p id="3.4">
"Peer-reviewed" publications refer to publications that have been evaluated by peers, i.e. other
scholars. Peer review is typically, yet not exclusively, organised by the journal or publisher to
which an article or manuscript is submitted. New approaches to the organisation of peer
review are expected to become more prevalent in the coming years. [Guidelines]
</p>

<p id="3.5">
The dominant type of peer-reviewed scientific publication is the journal article. In addition,
however, beneficiaries are strongly encouraged to provide open access to other types of
scientific publications, some of which may, in some cases, not be peer-reviewed, including
monographs, books, conference proceedings and grey literature (informally published written
material not controlled by scientific publishers, e.g. reports). [Guidelines]
</p>

<p id="3.6">
The open access mandate is composed of two steps: 1. depositing publications into
repositories, and 2. providing open access to them. These two steps may or may not occur at
the same time, depending on whether open access publishing ("gold" open access) or self-archiving ("green" open access) is used, and, in the case of self-archiving, depending on the
embargo period (if any). [Guidelines]
</p>

<p id="3.7">
Step 1: beneficiaries must deposit a machine-readable electronic copy of the published
version or final peer-reviewed manuscript accepted for publication in a repository for
scientific publications. This must be done as soon as possible and at the latest upon
publication. This step must be followed even where open access publishing ("gold" open
access) is chosen in order to ensure long-term preservation of the article. [Guidelines]
</p>

<p id="3.8">
The term "machine-readable electronic copy" means that the publications must be in a format
that can be used and understood by a computer. They must be stored using text file formats
which are either standardised or otherwise publicly known so that anyone can develop new
tools for working with these documents. [Guidelines]
</p>

<p id="3.9">
In some cases, the deposit of the final version of an article is possible before publication, for
example upon acceptance of the publication by the journal. The latest acceptable time to
deposit a publication is the date of publication. Where possible, the published version (in
terms of layout, pagination, etc.) should be deposited. [Guidelines]
</p>

<p id="3.10">
A repository for scientific publications is an online archive. Institutional, subject-based and
centralised repositories are all acceptable choices. Beneficiaries should not choose a
repository which claims rights over deposited publications and precludes access. The Open
Access Infrastructure for Research in Europe (OpenAIRE) is the recommended entry point for
researchers to determine what repository to choose (http://www.openaire.eu). OpenAIRE
also offers support services for researchers, such as the National Open Access Desks. Other
useful listings of repositories are the Registry of Open Access Repositories (ROAR,
http://roar.eprints.org/) and the Directory of Open Access Repositories (OpenDOAR,
http://www.opendoar.org/). [Guidelines]
</p>

<p id="3.11">
Moreover, the beneficiary must aim to deposit at the same time the research data needed to
validate the results presented in the deposited scientific publications, ideally into a data
repository. [Guidelines]
</p>

<p id="3.12">
This requirement is based on the fact that the concept of "publication" has rapidly evolved over
the past years and in the context of the digital era. Therefore, the notion of "publication"
increasingly includes the data underpinning the publication and results presented, also
referred to as "underlying" data. This data is needed to validate the results presented in the
deposited scientific publication and is therefore seen as a crucial part of the publication and an
important ingredient enabling scientific best practice. Beneficiaries are also invited to grant
open access to this data, but there is no obligation to do so. [Guidelines]
</p>

<p id="3.13">
Step 2: after depositing publications and, where possible, underlying data, beneficiaries must
ensure open access to the deposited publication via the chosen repository. [Guidelines]
</p>

<p id="3.14">
Beneficiaries can choose one of two main ways to comply with this requirement: [Guidelines]
</p>

<p id="3.15">
1) Self-archiving / "green" OA: beneficiaries can deposit the final peer-reviewed manuscript in
a repository of their choice (see explanation of "repository" above). In this case, they must
ensure open access to the publication within a maximum of six months (twelve months for
publications in the social sciences and humanities). [Guidelines]
</p>

<p id="3.16">
2) Open access publishing / "gold" OA: researchers can also publish in open access journals, or
in journals that sell subscriptions and also offer the possibility of making individual articles
openly accessible (hybrid journals). Monographs can also be published either via a "pure" open
access or via a hybrid business model. The author processing charges (APCs) for gold open
access incurred by beneficiaries are eligible for reimbursement during the duration of the
project (see article 6.2.D.3 of the Model Grant Agreement). In all cases, open access via the
chosen repository must be ensured upon publication. [Guidelines]
</p>

<p id="3.17">
The costs of "gold" open access publications incurred after the end of projects are not eligible
for reimbursement via the budget of the specific action. However, a mechanism is being
piloted for also dealing with open access publication charges incurred after the end of grant
agreements with the Commission. This pilot is supported via the OpenAIRE2020 project:
further information is available at https://www.openaire.eu/postgrantoapilot. [Guidelines]
</p>

<p id="3.18">
Beneficiaries must also ensure open access - via the repository - to the bibliographic
metadata that identify the deposited publication. The bibliographic metadata must be in a
standard format and must include the following:
<ul>
<li>the terms ["European Union (EU)" and "Horizon 2020"]["Euratom" and
Euratom research and training programme 2014-2018"];</li>
<li>the name of the action, acronym and grant number;</li>
<li>the publication date, and length of embargo period if applicable, and
a persistent identifier.</li>
</ul>
[Guidelines]
</p>

<p id="3.19">
The purpose of the requirement on metadata is to maximise the discoverability of publications
and to ensure the acknowledgment of EU funding. Bibliographic data mining is more efficient
than mining of full text versions. The inclusion of information relating to EU funding as part
of the bibliographic metadata is necessary for adequate monitoring, production of statistics,
and assessment of the impact of Horizon 2020. For adequate identification of the action
concerned, the grant number, name and/or acronym of the action is needed (preferably all
three). The publication date and embargo period enable the monitoring of the embargo
periods. The persistent identifier (for example a Digital Object Identifier, DOI) identifies the
publication. It allows linking to an authoritative version of the publication. For example,
OpenAIRE (http://www.openaire.eu) will provide means to check the metadata compliance of
the chosen repository. [Guidelines]
</p>

<p id="3.20">
In all cases, the Commission encourages authors to retain their copyright and grant adequate
licences to publishers. Creative Commons offers useful licensing solutions in this regard (e.g.
CC-BY or CC-0 licences, see http://creativecommons.org/licenses/). This type of licence is a
good legal tool to enable open access in its broadest sense. [Guidelines]
</p>

<p id="3.21">
Where possible, it is also recommended that contributors be uniquely identifiable, and data
uniquely attributable, through identifiers which are persistent, non-proprietary, open and
interoperable (e.g. through leveraging existing sustainable initiatives such as ORCID for
contributor identifiers and DataCite for data identifiers). [Guidelines]
